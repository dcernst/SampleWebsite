Flagstaff and NAU sit at the base of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks">San Francisco Peaks</a>, on homelands sacred to Native Americans throughout the region.  The Peaks, which includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak">Humphreys Peak</a> (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona, have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo">Diné</a> (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi">Hopi</a> name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top". The land in the area surrounding Flagstaff is the ancestral homeland of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi">Hopi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Apache_people">Ndee/Nnēē</a> (Western Apache), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavapai">Yavapai</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuni_people">A:shiwi</a> (Zuni Pueblo), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo">Diné</a> (Navajo). We honor their past, present, and future generations, who have lived here for millennia and will forever call this place home.
